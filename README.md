Enabled user authentication and performed various banking operations such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers. Included transaction history tracking and balance inquiries to enhance user experience. Focused on object-oriented principles to ensure code modularity and maintainability. Successfully demonstrated the project to showcase real-world banking transaction handling in a simulated environment.

Usage:-
